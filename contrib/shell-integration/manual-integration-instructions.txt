Windows Terminal & VS Code integration notes

What I did:
- Installed PowerShell helpers to: C:\Users\sp1d3\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
- Verified integration files under contrib/shell-integration/

What I could not auto-change:
- Windows Terminal: no settings.json detected in typical LocalState paths, so I did NOT modify your Windows Terminal settings.json.
- VS Code: either settings.json was absent or could not be parsed safely (comments). I did NOT modify your VS Code settings.json.

Manual steps you can run to add the profiles yourself:

Windows Terminal (open Settings -> Open JSON file) and add the profiles from:
- contrib/shell-integration/windows-terminal-profile.json

VS Code (open Settings JSON) and merge the object from:
- contrib/shell-integration/vscode-terminal-snippet.json

Files created / backed up by the script (if present):
- backups: *.bak next to your original settings files (if they existed)
- PowerShell profile backup: C:\Users\sp1d3\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1.bak (if existed)

If you want I can try again to merge into a specific settings.json path you confirm, or walk you through importing them interactively.
